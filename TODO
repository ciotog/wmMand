TODO

+ use libgdk, see bubblefishymon ** (current maintainer is not really interested
	in this, though)
+ julia-set (like in mand.unused.c, partly already available) or another fractal
	type
+ Use antialiasing for the large image

WISHLIST

+ faster calculations: use of mmx instructions? :) (again, current maintainer
	isn't really interested in this - the only really useful application of mmx
	for this program is with changing the colormap, and it's more than fast enough
	with such a small window size. Antialiasing would be done using inter-pixel
	points, so mmx wouldn't help with this)
