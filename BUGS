BUGS

Known:
	- Has been known to swallow all input and not release (happened to me once
		with xfce4) -- if this happens to you, try pressing 'q' or 'ESC', or
		use the combination CTRL-ALT-'/' (keypad divide), which kills grabs on
		stations where this option hasn't been disabled. Also please let me know
		what happened (preferably with instructions on how I can duplicate the
		issue)

Please send bug reports to:
	mghenderson@lanl.gov (original author Mike Henderson - not sure if this
		address is valid, or if he wants bug reports...)
	wmmand@ciotog.net (current updater Chris Craig)
