Verson 1.3.2, 14-03-2007
	- updated by Chris Craig <wmmand@ciotog.net>
	- added error trapping code for extremely low memory conditions
	- added a delay before unhiding the cursor (incidentally fixing a missing
	  'break' bug)
	- overhauled focus handling - no grabbing the keyboard until a button is
	  pressed inside the window, and any unhandled keypresses are passed to root

Version 1.3.1, 16-10-2006
	-	updated by Chris Craig <wmmand@ciotog.net>
	-	changed INSTALL file to recognize the format change from gz to bz2
	-	removed "show point and range info" from wishlist, as it's now available
		with the large display
	-	removed source code comments about unimplemented keyboard events (lru & d)
	-	added Home, End, PgUp and PgDown events for moving diagonally
	-	added zooming in and out with the mouse scroll-wheel
	-	added whitespace to all mathematical expressions in the code so they're
		easier to read
	-	very slight improvements to some calculations
	-	added -x / --xv command switches to allow the use of xv instead of display
		for the large image
	-	usage info has been made more readable
	-	added 'ESC' / 'q' key events to manually ungrab the pointer (maybe this
		works...)
	-	removed definition of TRUE and FALSE and used True and False provided by
		Xlib instead (since it's already #included, why not?)
	-	apparently usleep is obsolete (according to the info document) -	replaced
		by nanosleep (why argue with the library writers?)
	-	added the ability to launch the current view in XaoS with the 'x' key, if
		installed (XaoS can be obtained from http://xaos.sourceforge.net/)
	-	fixed the nagging issue where the mouse wasn't being confined using certain
		WMs (like Gnome, KDE, XFCE4)
	-	added toplevel Makefile to make compiling easier

Version 1.3, 12-04-2006
	-	updated by Chris Craig <wmmand@ciotog.net>
	-	added "autozoom" using the mouse
	-	removed 1 pizel border around image (why waste space?)
	-	more code tweaks and logic error fixes

Version 1.2.1, 11-03-2006
	-	updated by Chris Craig <wmmand@ciotog.net>
	-	Bugfixes, having stumbled across the bug reports for the Debian version,
		which was 1.1-2.1 as of March 2006
	-	'display' is called without the use of any temp file
	-	additionally, unlike the latest Debian version  wmMand isn't suspended
		while display is used -	this means that multiple large displays may be
		opened
	-	the display title also gives the current center point and range for the
		part of the plane it shows

	-	updated by Chris Craig <wmmand@ciotog.net>
